# FindSumeetSum
Find SumeetSum: Sum of largest 3-digit numbers from given 5 numbers
Given 5 input numbers, Sumeet has to find the sum of the largest numbers that can be produced 
using 3 digits from each of the above 5 numbers.

Example-1:
If the 5 input numbers are 23792, 37221, 10270, 73391 and 12005. The largest numbers that can 
be produced using 3 digits from each of these are 973, 732, 721, 973 and 521 respectively, and 
the sum of these largest numbers will be 3920. Therefore, the expected result is 3920.

Example-2:
If the 5 input numbers are 26674, 105, 37943, 95278 and 27845, The largest numbers that can be 
produced using 3 digits from each of these are 766,510,974,987 and 875 respectively, and the 
sum of these largest numbers will be 4112. Therefore, the expected result is 4112.

NOTE: All the given 5 numbers will be >=100 and <= 99999
Function prototype is as belowInt findSumeetSum(int input1,int input2,int input3,int input4,int input5).
